Speech To Text Using Dictation (Advanced)
This programs detects Speech Dictation better than most dictation programs. There are better ones on the market, but if you dedicate some time
(If you can afford to) ask users go to the training process that will certainly yield you much better results. 
I have used for myself (and I have an accent) and it improved significantly the accuracy of the recognition in my applications. 
At the very least you can try it yourself (Control Panel, Speech Recognition, Train your computer to better understand you). 
Really, training or reducing the model (or of course using your app in a quiet place with a better microphone) are the only ways to improve the accuracy of your results.
Also: Below are some good mics to purchase at an affordable price, (the top selection is best.)
